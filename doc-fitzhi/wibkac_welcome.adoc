fitzhì is an open-source skills management project, initially developed for software companies (first tests are executed inside an IT service centers). 
You are allow to alter the scope of fitzhì, but key features wont not relevant without IT projects.

fitzhì is declared under the MIT License +
Therefore, you are absolutely free to fork, enhance and update this present application. 
You are also very welcomed to get involved in the project. *We look for contributors to enhance fitzhì*.

This first release of fitzhì has been developed with a front-end in Angular and a back-end server in Java(TM) / Spring Boot(C). +
No database is required. All data are stored in JSON files, located on the file system. 
A periodic saving procedure can be scheduled to push these files on a Git repository. 
No complex administration is needed. We intend to design the most-easy-to-use-and-deploy application.
fitzhì is a light solution. It has been designed in that way,  because of the low volume of information. 
If you company has more than 1 millions of employees, this product is not for you.

fitzhì is also very tied to the version control software GIT(TM). +
Some of the features are very connected to this repository. 
We still dream/plan to implement other releases for SVN(TM), Microsoft's TFS... Once again, contributors are welcome. +
_Lazy people might be productive people :_ 
We try to avoid the double entry of information so, as often as possible, the tool will strive to extract information from the repository.

|deploy
|Main deployment directory
|deploy/backend-fitzhì
|the directory of the executable fitzhì.jar
|deploy/data
|the data directories used by fitzhì
|deploy/data/application

All of your updates will be stored there.
|deploy/data/referential
|the referential data which contains the static data used by the application
|===

You can copy the deploy directory on a remote server, or leave it, on your machine, for testing purpose.
The back-end URL, therefore, will be http://localhost:8080 


To start the back-end fitzhì, just type:
[source, shell]
----
deploy/backend-fitzhì/fitzhì.jar
