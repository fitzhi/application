# This boolean is setting the fact that the eligibility validation is made :
# prior to the creation of the repository-chart data file, 
# or after.
# 
# Techxhì is storing intermediate data on a file named 'project.id'-'project.name'.json.
#
# The consequence of this settings is :
# - if TRUE, the full global generation will be faster, because data are already filtered. 
#            But, if you want to change the pattern of inclusion, on the fly, 
#            you will have to regenerate the full chart.
#
# - If FALSE, the crawler catch all files in the repository (the whole repository), 
#             before working, or filtering on it.
#             The generation will be slower, but the chart will be faster to filter.
